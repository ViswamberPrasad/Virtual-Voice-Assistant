# Virtual-Voice-Assistant
NLP Voice Assistant,coded completely in Python,as my Python(Intermediate)Capstone Project. Definitely not the best code you would find for such a project,but it gets the job done.The hot word detection mechanism of the assistant,has been coded with simple logic,rather than using tools such as SnowBoy. NLTK's Sentiment Analysis has been used,for the emotion analysis of the user.
